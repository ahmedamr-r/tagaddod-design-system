# Next.js 15 Upgrade Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed `next` from `14.2.28` to `15.0.3`
   - Changed `eslint-config-next` from `14.2.28` to `15.0.3`

2. **Analyzed the codebase for breaking changes**:
   - No async API usage (cookies, headers, params) found
   - No server actions or middleware that need updates
   - All components use client-side rendering

3. **No code changes required** because:
   - The app is primarily client-side
   - Doesn't use the APIs that became async in Next.js 15
   - Doesn't use Speed Insights

## Next Steps

1. Run `yarn install` to update dependencies
2. Clear Next.js cache with `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart the development server with `yarn dev`

## Key Breaking Changes in Next.js 15 (Not Affecting This App)

- **Async Request APIs**: `cookies()`, `headers()`, `params`, and `searchParams` are now async
- **React 19 Support**: Supports React 19 RC while maintaining React 18 compatibility
- **Speed Insights**: Auto instrumentation removed

Since this app doesn't use these features, the upgrade is straightforward.

## Verification

After running `yarn install` and restarting the dev server, verify:
- Token table loads correctly
- CRUD operations work
- GitHub integration functions properly
- No console errors

The upgrade to Next.js 15 is complete with no code changes needed!
