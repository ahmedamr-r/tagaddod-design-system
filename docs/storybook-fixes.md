# Storybook Configuration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

1. **Stories Location Error**
   - Problem: Storybook was looking for stories in `packages/storybook/src/**` which doesn't exist
   - Fix: Updated `main.ts` to point to `../../react/src/**/*.stories.*`

2. **Component Import Path**
   - Problem: Button.stories.tsx was trying to import Button from `./Button`
   - Fix: Updated import to `../Button` (correct relative path)

3. **Refs Configuration**
   - Problem: Refs configuration was pointing to directory instead of valid package URL
   - Fix: Removed refs since stories are in the same monorepo

4. **Button.stories.tsx Syntax Error**
   - Problem: File was truncated, causing unterminated string error
   - Fix: Recreated complete Button.stories.tsx file with all story variations

5. **ESM/CommonJS Compatibility**
   - Problem: Main.ts was using CommonJS require in ESM context
   - Fix: Removed unnecessary path resolution code

## Files Modified

1. `/packages/storybook/.storybook/main.ts`
   - Updated stories path
   - Removed refs configuration
   - Removed unnecessary ESM/CommonJS compatibility code

2. `/packages/storybook/.storybook/preview.tsx`
   - Updated imports to use relative paths
   - Fixed token and style imports

3. `/packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.stories.tsx`
   - Fixed component import path
   - Recreated complete file with all story variations

## Current Status

✅ Storybook is now running successfully on port 6006
✅ Button component stories are loading correctly
✅ Design tokens are properly integrated
✅ Theme switching is functional

## Warnings (Non-Critical)

- Source map warnings for CSS files (doesn't affect functionality)
- These can be ignored or addressed later with proper source map generation
