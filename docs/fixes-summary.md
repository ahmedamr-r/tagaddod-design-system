# Token Admin Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Tokens Not Loading in Table
**Problem**: The token table was empty even though token files existed in the monorepo.

**Solution**: 
- Created a `tokenLoader.ts` utility that loads tokens from the monorepo packages
- Added `useEffect` hook in `TokenAdmin.tsx` to load tokens on component mount
- Created combined `primitives.json` and `semantics.json` files for easier importing

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Load tokens from packages on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const loadInitialTokens = async () => {
    const tokens = await loadTokensFromPackages();
    store.loadTokens(tokens);
  };
  loadInitialTokens();
}, []);
```

### 2. GitHub API Authentication Error
**Problem**: GitHub API was failing with authentication errors when trying to load branches.

**Solution**:
- Added input fields for GitHub Personal Access Token, repository owner, and repository name
- Created dynamic GitHub client that's only initialized when credentials are provided
- Added proper error messages to guide users

**Implementation**:
- Added GitHub configuration section in the Import tab
- Used `useMemo` to create GitHub client only when credentials are available
- Added validation to prevent GitHub operations without proper authentication

## How to Use

### Loading Tokens
- Tokens are now automatically loaded when you open the Token Admin app
- You should see existing tokens from the monorepo in the table

### Using GitHub Integration
1. Go to the Import tab
2. Select "GitHub Branch" as the import source
3. Enter your GitHub credentials:
   - Personal Access Token (generate at github.com/settings/tokens with `repo` scope)
   - Repository Owner (your GitHub username)
   - Repository Name (default: tagaddod-design-system)
4. Click "Load GitHub Branches"
5. Select a branch and click "Import from Selected Branch"

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding environment variables for GitHub configuration in production
2. Add a loading indicator while tokens are being loaded initially
3. Consider caching GitHub credentials in localStorage for convenience
4. Add validation for repository existence before attempting operations
