# Token Admin Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Edit Button Not Working**
   - Fixed incorrect import path for TokenEditDrawer component
   - Created TokenEditDrawer component in the correct location
   - Now clicking the Edit button properly opens the drawer

2. **Component Modularization**
   - Split the main page into smaller, focused components:
     - `TokenAdminHeader`: Handles title and action buttons
     - `TokenTabs`: Manages tab switching UI
     - `ErrorMessage`: Displays error states
     - `BuiltTokensTable`: Renders built tokens in read-only mode
     - `TokenEditDrawer`: Handles token editing in a side drawer
   - This makes the codebase more maintainable and testable

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - **Memoization**: Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - **Pagination**: Added pagination to TokenTable (50 items per page by default)
   - **Optimized Token Flattening**: Memoized the flattenTokens function to avoid recalculations
   - **Callback Optimization**: Memoized all event handlers to prevent recreation
   - **Component Isolation**: Split components prevent full page re-renders

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Re-renders**
   - Memoized columns definition
   - Memoized data transformation
   - Callbacks don't trigger re-renders

2. **Better Data Handling**
   - Pagination reduces DOM nodes
   - Configurable page sizes (20, 50, 100 items)
   - Efficient search filtering

3. **Component-Level Optimization**
   - Each component manages its own state
   - Props are optimized to pass only necessary data
   - Focused re-renders instead of full-page updates

## New Features

1. **Drawer-Based Editing**
   - Clean UI with slide-in drawer
   - Form validation
   - Better UX than inline editing

2. **Improved Navigation**
   - Clear pagination controls
   - Page size selector
   - Smooth transitions

## Usage

The app now works as follows:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/
2. Click the "Edit" button on any token row
3. A drawer will slide in from the right
4. Make changes and click "Save Changes"
5. The token will be updated and the drawer will close

## Architecture Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Components are easier to update individually
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Only affected components re-render on state changes
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
