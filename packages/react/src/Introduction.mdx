# Tagaddod Design System

Welcome to the Tagaddod Design System documentation. This design system provides a comprehensive collection of reusable components, design tokens, and guidelines to help build consistent and accessible user interfaces across the Tagaddod ecosystem.

## Features

- **Multi-brand support**: Switch between Tagaddod and GreenPan themes
- **RTL/LTR support**: Full bidirectional text support for Arabic and English
- **Design tokens**: Comprehensive token system for colors, spacing, typography, and more
- **Accessible components**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with responsive components

## Getting Started

The design system is built as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `@tagaddod/tokens`: Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- `@tagaddod/react`: React components library
- `@tagaddod/themes`: Brand theme configurations

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from '@tagaddod/react';
import '@tagaddod/react/styles/index.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Theme Switching

Use the toolbar above to switch between themes and text directions to see how components adapt to different contexts.

## Available Tokens

- **Colors**: Brand colors, semantic colors, surface colors
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale from 0 to 3200
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Border**: Radius and width tokens
