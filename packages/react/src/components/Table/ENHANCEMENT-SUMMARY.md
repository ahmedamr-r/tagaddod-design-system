# Table Component Enhancements

## Recent Updates (May 2025)

1. **Filter Button Improvements**
   - Fixed filter button active state to use neutral tone instead of magic/purple
   - Added proper active styling with custom CSS class to maintain consistent design
   - Button now displays a clear active state when filters are applied

2. **RTL Support Fixes**
   - Fixed tabs display in RTL mode by explicitly setting the `dir` attribute
   - Ensured proper alignment of content in RTL layout
   - Improved content flow for Arabic text

3. **Header Cell Sorting Enhancements**
   - Replaced chevron icons with arrow-up and arrow-down icons for clearer sorting indication
   - Added hover state to sortable header cells for better interactive feedback
   - Added active/sorted state styling with bottom border indicator
   - Improved click event handling for more reliable sorting
   - Added proper keyboard accessibility (role, tabindex, aria-sort)

4. **Filter Dropdown Z-Index Fixes**
   - Fixed issue where filter dropdowns blocked hover states on table cells beneath them
   - Improved stacking context to ensure hover effects work properly with open dropdowns
   - Added proper z-index management between filters and table content
   - Enhanced row hover state visibility when dropdowns are active

5. **Filter Component Redesign**
   - Implemented new filter UI with three distinct states:
     - Initial state: Dashed border with plus icon
     - Hover state: Background changes with chevron rotation
     - Selected state: Solid border with filter value and X icon
   - Added smooth 200ms animations for transitions between states
   - Improved visual hierarchy with proper spacing and icon alignment
   - The "+" icon rotates 45Â° to become an "X" icon when filters are applied
   - Made X icon clickable to clear the filter directly (one-click filter removal)
   - Added hover effect for X icon with color change and additional rotation
   - Refined styling for better consistency with design system
   - Active state maintained when filter dropdown is open, even when hovering elsewhere
   - Added special CSS class for popover active state with persistent visual feedback

## Implementation Details

- The header cells now have proper hover and active styles
- Background colors now use the correct design tokens for consistency
- Sort indicators clearly show ascending/descending state
- The filter button uses consistent styling with other tertiary buttons
- RTL support is properly implemented for both tabs and table content
- Z-index values adjusted to maintain proper interaction with filters open
- Table rows now use appropriate z-index to ensure hover states display correctly
- Filter components match designs with dashed borders in initial state
- Icon transitions use CSS animations with proper timing
- Filters maintain active appearance when their dropdown is open
- Added click-to-clear functionality on X icon for improved UX
- Enhanced icon interactivity with accessible ARIA labels

## Usage Notes

No API changes were made, so existing table implementations will automatically benefit from these enhancements. The styling improvements provide better visual feedback for interactive elements and more consistent theming across the component.
